This is our BC13005 Image Steganography project.
First, we compress the text and pad it to mod 128.
Then, we perform AES encryption on it.
We embed the result in an image.
We retrieve that image.
Then perform AES decryption.
Then remove padding and then decompress text.
Here, the data to be shared is first compressed, encrypted, then embedded in a carrier file (an image in our case).
It provides a multiple of layers of protection of the data.
And not only is the data encrypted, if the attacker manages to break the first layer of encryption,
the information won’t make any sense, as it’ll just be the carrier file.
The additional module used is opencv which is used only for reading and modifying image pixels.
There are 3 members in the project with modules divided to everyone.
