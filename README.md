# Image Steganography Using an Edge Based Embedding Technique
Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, by embedding it into an audio, video, 
image or text file, called a carrier or data carrier, more specifically. It is one of the 
methods employed to protect secret or sensitive data from malicious attacks. 
Cryptography and steganography are both methods used to hide or protect secret data. 
However, they differ in the respect that cryptography makes the data unreadable, or hides 
the meaning of the data, while steganography hides the existence of the data. 

# Algorithm used
Huffman Coding for text compression and decompression 
AES for traditional encryption and decryption
Custom technique for embedding
